### padmixer

- this is a prototype of a tool that maps pad input to key presses.
- for me, it works as a display-locked overlay in wayland user space.
- many more features focused on experimental ergonomics are planned.
- at the moment it is a basic prototype. this is proof of bare functionality.
- it is a hardcoded radial menu on the right stick of a connected gamepad.
